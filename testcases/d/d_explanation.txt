Branch change of "ABC" iss due to his first preference.Strength of ME falls to 15 which is 75% of 20.
Branch change of "SRA" is not done in the initial iteration because Max Strength of EE is reached now.
"RIS" also doesn't get his branch changed in the first iteration due to the 75% rule for ME Branch.
"NUJ" gets his branch changed to CS as he falls in SET2 of rules. Note that his CPI is same as "RIS" and the Strength of EE falls to 10 again.
"AGA" is also not allowed to change branch in initial iteration , since a guy with higher cpi(8.88) was not allowed branch change.
"TAL" gets CS because of the MIN CPI rule.

Now in the next and final iteration,

"SRA" gets a branch change to "EE B.Tech" because strength of EE was 10 at that time.
"RIS" gets a branch change to "CS" because of the MIN CPI rule.
"AGA" still doesn't get a branch change because of max strength of CS is reached.
